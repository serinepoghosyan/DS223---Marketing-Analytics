## Project Overview
This project applies the **Bass Diffusion Model** to forecast the global market adoption of the **Insta360 X4**, one of *TIME’s Best Inventions of 2024*.  
The study uses the **GoPro MAX (2019)** as the historical analogue to estimate the diffusion parameters (p and q) and leverages **CIPA digital camera shipment data (1999–2024)** for fitting and validation. The model captures the rise, peak, and decline of the digital camera market and extends those dynamics to predict adoption for the new 360° action camera generation.

## Methodology Summary

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Choose an Innovation** | Selected the Insta360 X4 (2024) — a compact 360° action camera for creators, athletes, and travelers. |
| **2. Select an Analogue** | Used the GoPro MAX (2019) as the historical analogue, which shares core 360° capture and stabilization technology. |
| **3. Gather Data** | Annual global digital camera shipment data from the **Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA)**, 1999–2024. |
| **4. Estimate Bass Model** | Fitted Bass model parameters (p, q, M) to CIPA data using nonlinear least squares in R. |
| **5. Forecast Diffusion** | Simulated 10-year adoption (2025–2034) of the Insta360 X4 using transferred Bass parameters. |
| **6. Scope** | Global market scope — consistent with worldwide CIPA data and Insta360’s international distribution. |
| **7. Estimate Adopters by Period** | Computed annual and cumulative adopters using Bass equations under base, low, and high (±20%) market-potential scenarios. |

## Key Parameters and Insights

| Parameter | Symbol | Estimate |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Coefficient of innovation | p | 0.0050 |
| Coefficient of imitation | q | 0.3855 |
| Market potential (historical analog) | M | 1,214 million units |
| Predicted market potential (Insta360 X4) | M | 20 million units |
| Peak adoption time | t* | ≈ 11.1 years after launch |

**Interpretation:**  
The low *p* and high *q* indicate that adoption of digital imaging devices was primarily driven by **imitation and word-of-mouth** rather than advertising. The diffusion curve matches the observed digital camera peak (~2010) and decline thereafter.

For the **Insta360 X4**, diffusion is expected to peak around **2035**, with approximately **1.9M units sold annually** and cumulative adopters reaching **~7.7M (≈38% of M)** within 10 years of launch.

These figures demonstrate that the Bass model accurately replicates the lifecycle of digital camera shipments, validating parameter use for new-product forecasting.
